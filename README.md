# AES Malware Development

Welcome to the AES Malware Development repository. This project provides educational resources and examples on using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) in malware development. AES is a robust symmetric encryption algorithm employed to obscure malicious payloads, enhancing their chances of evading detection.

## Overview

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric encryption algorithm known for its security and efficiency. In malware development, AES is used to:

- **Encrypt Payloads**: Protect the malicious payload by encrypting it, making it harder for security solutions to detect.
- **Enhance Obfuscation**: Ensure that the payload remains concealed until it is decrypted at runtime.

This repository explores how AES encryption can be implemented in malware, including practical examples and theoretical explanations.
